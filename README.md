## Technical comments

### Dependencies

  + ROOT
  

### Comments

The notebook example doesn't seem to work well and all setup. Several minor features are not working properly
  + the magic command `autoreload` doesn't work (nothing to do with this pacakge)
  + the displayed canvas is not correct (should be connected to ROOT-related tool versions)
